\title{Summarize a Causal Learner Fit}
\usage{
\method{summary}{causal_learner}(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{causal_learner} (e.g., \code{s_learner},
\code{t_learner}, \code{x_learner}) created by their corresponding functions.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{summary.causal_learner} containing:
\item{mode}{The model mode ("regression" or "classification").}
\item{bootstrap_mode}{Logical, whether bootstrap estimates are used.}
\item{estimates}{A list of causal effect estimates (regression or classification).}
\item{policy_mode}{Logical, whether policy evaluation results are included.}
\item{policy_details}{Policy details (threshold, gain) if available.}
}
\description{
Produces a summary of a causal learner model fit (S-Learner, T-Learner,
X-Learner), including treatment effect estimates, bootstrap-based inference
(if available), and optional policy evaluation results.
}
\details{
The summary output depends on the learner type and model mode:
\itemize{
\item \strong{S-Learner}: Uses a single fitted model with treatment as a feature.
\item \strong{T-Learner}: Fits two separate models (treated and control) and compares predictions.
\item \strong{X-Learner}: Combines two initial T-Learner models to impute treatment effects
and then trains a meta-model on the imputed effects for refined estimates.
}

Within each learner type, results differ by mode:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Regression mode}: Reports ATE, ATT, and ATC.
\item \strong{Classification mode}: Reports ATE, ATT, ATC plus causal effect measures:
Risk Ratio (RR), Risk Difference (RD), Odds Ratio (OR), Number Needed to Treat (NNT),
Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency (PNS), and Probability of Necessity (PN).
}

If bootstrap estimates were computed during fitting, those replace point estimates.

If policy evaluation was performed during fitting, the summary includes the best
decision threshold and associated gain.
