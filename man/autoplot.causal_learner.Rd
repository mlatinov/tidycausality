\title{Visualize Causal Learner Model Results}
\usage{
\method{autoplot}{causal_learner}(
  object,
  type = c("forest", "density", "cumulative", "uplift"),
  group = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{causal_learner} (e.g., \code{s_learner},
\code{t_learner}, \code{x_learner} ), as returned by the corresponding modeling functions.}

\item{type}{Type of plot to generate. Must be one of:
\describe{
\item{\code{"density"}}{Density plot of the estimated ITEs.}
\item{\code{"forest"}}{Forest plot showing ITE estimates, either for individual
observations or grouped means.}
\item{\code{"cumulative"}}{Cumulative Average Effect (CAE) curve, showing the
cumulative impact of treating an increasing proportion of the population
ranked by ITE.}
\item{\code{"uplift"}}{Uplift curve (Qini curve), comparing the cumulative
incremental gain of the model's targeting strategy against a random
targeting strategy. The area between these curves is the Qini coefficient.}
}}

\item{group}{Optional. A string specifying the name of a categorical variable
in the original dataset. If provided, the \code{"density"}, \code{"forest"}, and
\code{"cumulative"} plots will be faceted or grouped by the levels of this variable.
Ignored for \code{type = "uplift"}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object representing the chosen visualization. The plot can
be further customized with standard \strong{ggplot2} functions.
}
\description{
Generates diagnostic and summary plots for causal learner models
(e.g., S-Learner, T-Learner) to analyze the distribution and
impact of Individual Treatment Effects (ITEs).
}
\details{
This function provides multiple ways to visualize causal learner results:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Density Plot}: Shows the distribution of ITEs, with a dashed vertical line
at ITE = 0. Useful for assessing heterogeneity of treatment effects and the
proportion of the population with positive, negative, or neutral effects.
\item \strong{Forest Plot}: For \code{group = NULL}, displays each observation's ITE (ranked).
When a \code{group} variable is supplied, shows the mean ITE per subgroup, enabling
comparisons across categories.
\item \strong{Cumulative Plot}: Also known as the Cumulative Average Effect (CAE) curve.
It plots the average ITE if the top X\% of the population (ranked by predicted ITE)
were treated. Steeper initial curves indicate stronger prioritization ability.
\item \strong{Uplift Plot}: Plots cumulative incremental gain as an increasing fraction of
the population is treated. The model curve is compared to a random targeting
baseline. The difference between the two (area under the curve) is the Qini
coefficientâ€”a standard measure of uplift performance.
}

Supports \code{s_learner} and \code{t_learner} classes; \code{x_learner}

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assume you have a fitted causal learner model
library(ggplot2)

# Overall density of ITEs
autoplot(s_learner_fit, type = "density")

# Density grouped by age group
autoplot(s_learner_fit, type = "density", group = "age_group")

# Forest plot
autoplot(t_learner_fit, type = "forest")

# Cumulative gains
autoplot(s_learner_fit, type = "cumulative")

# Uplift curve with Qini coefficient
autoplot(s_learner_fit, type = "uplift")
