\title{Print Method for Causal Learner Summaries}
\usage{
\method{print}{summary.causal_learner}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to or from other methods (ignored).}

\item{x}{An object of class \code{"summary.causal_learner"} created by
\code{summary()} methods for causal learners (e.g.,
\code{summary.s_learner()}, \code{summary.t_learner()},
\code{summary.x_learner()}).}
}
\value{
Prints a formatted summary to the console and (invisibly) returns the input
object \code{x}.
}
\description{
Custom print method for objects of class \code{"summary.causal_learner"}.
Displays the learner type (e.g., S-Learner, T-Learner, X-Learner),
key causal effect measures, and additional details such as bootstrap
intervals and policy evaluation results in a clean, human-readable format.
}
\details{
The header identifies which causal learner was used:
\itemize{
\item \strong{S-Learner}
\item \strong{T-Learner}
\item \strong{X-Learner}
}

The effect measures depend on the mode of the fitted model:
\itemize{
\item For \strong{regression}, the following are displayed:
\itemize{
\item Average Treatment Effect (ATE)
\item Average Treatment Effect on Treated (ATT)
\item Average Treatment Effect on Control (ATC)
}
\item For \strong{classification}, additional causal effect measures are included:
\itemize{
\item Risk Ratio (RR)
\item Risk Difference (RD)
\item Odds Ratio (OR)
\item Number Needed to Treat (NNT)
\item Probability of Necessity & Sufficiency (PNS)
\item Probability of Necessity (PN)
}
}

If bootstrap estimation was performed, confidence intervals are displayed
alongside point estimates.
If policy evaluation was included, the best threshold and associated gain
are also shown.
