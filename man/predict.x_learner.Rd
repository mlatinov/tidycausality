\title{Predict Conditional Average Treatment Effects with X-Learner Model}
\usage{
\method{predict}{x_learner}(object, new_data, treatment = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{x_learner} returned by \code{x_learner()} function.
This object must contain fitted outcome models, CATE models, and propensity score model.}

\item{new_data}{A \code{data.frame} or \code{tibble} containing new observations for which to
predict treatment effects. Must include the treatment indicator column and all predictors used in training.}

\item{treatment}{A string specifying the name of the treatment indicator column in \code{new_data}.
This column should be binary (0/1).}
}
\value{
A \code{tibble} with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{tau_hat}: The combined estimated conditional average treatment effect (CATE).
\item \code{tau_hat_treated}: CATE estimates from the model trained on treated group pseudo-outcomes.
\item \code{tau_hat_control}: CATE estimates from the model trained on control group pseudo-outcomes.
\item \code{propensity_score}: Estimated propensity score (probability of treatment).
}
}
\description{
Generates individualized treatment effect estimates (CATE) using a fitted X-learner model.
}
\details{
This method implements the prediction step for the X-learner meta-algorithm:
\itemize{
\item Uses the fitted outcome models to compute pseudo-outcomes on treated and control groups.
\item Applies CATE models trained separately on these pseudo-outcomes.
\item Estimates propensity scores to weight and combine CATE predictions.
}

If no observations exist for a treatment group in \code{new_data}, the corresponding CATE predictions
for that group will be \code{NA}.

# Assuming `xmod` is a fitted x_learner model
preds <- predict(xmod, new_data = new_dataset, treatment = "treatment")
