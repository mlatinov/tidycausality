**tidycausality** is a development-stage R package for causal machine learning, built for seamless integration with the **tidymodels** ecosystem. It provides a unified, extensible framework for estimating treatment effects using modern ML techniques ‚Äî starting with **causal forests**.

## üîç What is tidycausality?

`tidycausality` is a **tidy-first**, **modular**, and **extensible** package that:

- Implements causal models using `parsnip`-style specifications.
- Supports flexible prediction of **heterogeneous treatment effects (CATEs)**.
- Can integrate with tuning frameworks like `tune`, and feature engineering tools like `recipes`.
- Aims for **transparent, customizable** modeling workflows for researchers and applied data scientists.
